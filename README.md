BASIC IDEOLOGY 
1.Our idea is to create three databases which hold the records of the follows : 
◦ Database for Newly discovered Diseases, its treatment and its cure. 
◦ Database of Pet Owners and Pet shop owners in which they will register themselves. 
◦ Database of Doctors in which all the doctors register themselves. 
2. There will be a section where Verified Doctors will give regular update as their post about Diseases and its precaution . 
3. Whenever any new Disease is discover there will be a POP-UP in contact details of doctors and owners which was registered.
4. There will be a chat server for Doctors and owners for interaction between them . 
5. There will also a Warning POP-UP whenever any chronic disease is spreading.

1. LABORATORIES: 
• This is the place where the new diseases is discover. 
• They will provide all the necessary details about the diseases like treatment, medicines, how to cure, etc.
• They will send all the information to the NADRS. 2. National Animal Diseases Reporting System (NADRS): 
• They will first verify the report. 
• Then they will send report to the registered doctors and owners. 
3. Doctors: 
• They get regular update so that the doctor gets aware from that disease.
